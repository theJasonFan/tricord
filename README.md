# tricord

Run a command, watch its entire process tree, and report how much CPU,
memory, and disk I/O it used. The companion binary is named `tricorder`.

Think of it as a more thorough `/usr/bin/time -v`: it polls the process tree
on an interval, follows children and grandchildren, and writes a single
record summarising peak memory, total bytes read/written, average CPU load,
and total CPU time. Output is a tidy TSV, one-line JSON, or pretty-printed
JSON, suited to spreadsheets, pipelines, and human readers.

[Visit us at Fulcrum Genomics](https://www.fulcrumgenomics.com) to learn more about how we can power your bioinformatics with tricord and beyond.

## Highlights

- **Whole-tree accounting** — follows forked children and aggregates their
  resource usage; an exited child's I/O is still counted.
- **Three output formats** — TSV (Snakemake-compatible prefix, extended with
  `tricord`-specific columns by default), one-line JSON (`--format json`)
  for programmatic consumers, or pretty-printed JSON (`--format json-pretty`)
  for human readers. Pass `--snakemake` to emit the strict 10-column
  Snakemake schema when downstream tooling pins to it.
- **Optional one-line summary** to stderr (`--summary`).
- **Optional per-tick trace** (`--trace <PATH>`) — one TSV row per sample, so
  you can see how memory, I/O, and CPU evolved during the run instead of just
  the final aggregate.
- **Optional Markdown export** (`--export-markdown <PATH>`) — renders the
  aggregate record as a two-column Markdown table, ready to paste into PR
  descriptions, issue comments, and design docs.
- **Clean shutdown** — forwards `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` / `SIGHUP` to the
  child's process group so orchestrators can tear runs down without
  leaking children.
- **No runtime dependencies** — single self-contained Rust binary.
  No Python, no `psutil`.
- **Cross-platform** — Linux (full column set) and macOS (graceful
  degradation; see [Platform notes](#platform-notes)).

## Installation

Requires Rust 1.94.0 or later.

```bash
cargo install tricord
# This installs the `tricorder` binary (the crate name is `tricord`,
# the binary name is `tricorder`).

# Or, from source:
git clone https://github.com/fg-labs/tricord.git
cd tricord
cargo build --release
# Binary is at target/release/tricorder
```

## Usage

```bash
tricorder --out timing.tsv -- bash -c 'samtools sort -@ 8 big.bam -o sorted.bam'
```

```text
Usage: tricorder [OPTIONS] --out <PATH> -- <CMD>...

Options:
      --out <PATH>           Output file path
      --format <FORMAT>      tsv | json | json-pretty [default: tsv]
      --interval <SECONDS>   Sampling interval [default: 0.5]
      --summary              Print one-line summary to stderr after the run
      --trace <PATH>         Also write a per-tick TSV trace to this path
      --export-markdown <PATH>
                             Also write a Markdown table of the aggregate
                             record to this path
      --snakemake            Emit only the original Snakemake aggregate schema
                             (TSV, JSON, and Markdown). Does not affect --trace.
  -v, --verbose...           Increase log level (-v, -vv, -vvv)
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

The command to benchmark is everything after the `--` separator. No shell
interpretation is done by `tricorder` itself; if you need shell features (pipes,
quoting), invoke `bash -c '...'` explicitly.

## Output

### TSV (default)

By default `tricorder` emits a Snakemake-compatible 10-column prefix followed
by every column it has added on top (`tricord`-extended schema). Pass
`--snakemake` to drop the additions and produce exactly the original
Snakemake schema; the prefix's column order and value formatting are
identical in both modes.

```text
s	h:m:s	max_rss	max_vms	max_uss	max_pss	io_in	io_out	mean_load	cpu_time	major_page_faults	minor_page_faults	voluntary_ctx_switches	involuntary_ctx_switches	peak_n_threads	peak_n_procs	loadavg_1m_start	loadavg_1m_end	max_swap	page_cache_start	page_cache_end
12.3456	0:00:12	101.50	2048.00	95.20	96.00	1.25	0.50	175.00	21.60	42	1234	80	7	13	4	0.50	2.25	64.00	512.00	480.25
```

| Column | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | seconds (`%.4f`) | Wall-clock running time |
| `h:m:s` | `H:MM:SS` | Same value, human-readable |
| `max_rss` | MiB (`%.2f`) | Peak summed RSS across the process tree |
| `max_vms` | MiB | Peak summed virtual memory size |
| `max_uss` | MiB | Peak summed unique set size |
| `max_pss` | MiB | Peak summed proportional set size (Linux only — see below) |
| `io_in` | MiB | Total bytes read from disk by the process tree |
| `io_out` | MiB | Total bytes written to disk by the process tree |
| `mean_load` | percent of one core | Average CPU load over the run (e.g. 175 = 1.75 cores) |
| `cpu_time` | seconds | Total user + system CPU time across the process tree |
| `major_page_faults` | integer | Total major page faults (pages brought in from backing store) across the tree. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. |
| `minor_page_faults` | integer | Total minor page faults across the tree. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. Always `-` on macOS — see [Platform notes](#platform-notes). |
| `voluntary_ctx_switches` | integer | Total voluntary context switches across the tree (processes yielding the CPU on their own — typically waiting on I/O or a sleep). `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. Always `-` on macOS. |
| `involuntary_ctx_switches` | integer | Total involuntary context switches across the tree (processes preempted by the scheduler). `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. Always `-` on macOS. |
| `peak_n_threads` | integer | Peak instantaneous thread count across the tree — max over sampling ticks of the summed per-process thread counts. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. |
| `peak_n_procs` | integer | Peak instantaneous live-process count across the tree — max over sampling ticks of how many processes were observed. Catches "I asked for 16 workers but the tool spawned 200." `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. |
| `loadavg_1m_start` | float (`%.2f`) | System 1-minute load average sampled just before the child started. Frames the rest of the numbers — a peak `cpu_time` of 800% on an idle host (loadavg ~1) means something very different from the same peak on a thrashing host. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. |
| `loadavg_1m_end` | float (`%.2f`) | System 1-minute load average sampled just after the child exited. Paired with `loadavg_1m_start` to show whether the run drove the host load up. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. |
| `max_swap` | MiB | Peak summed swap usage across the process tree (max over sampling ticks of `VmSwap` summed across PIDs). `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. Always `-` on macOS — the kernel has no public per-process swap-usage API. |
| `page_cache_start` | MiB | System page-cache size (`Cached` in `/proc/meminfo`) sampled just before the child started. Frames the memory numbers the same way `loadavg_1m_start` frames CPU numbers: a run slowed by page-cache eviction from other work on the host looks identical to a real regression without it. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. On macOS renders `-` (no `Cached` equivalent) once a sample was taken, or `NA` like every other resource column if the run ended before the first sample — see [Platform notes](#platform-notes). |
| `page_cache_end` | MiB | System page-cache size sampled just after the child exited. Paired with `page_cache_start` — a drop is a direct sign the run (or a neighbor) evicted cached pages. `tricord`-added; omitted under `--snakemake`. On macOS renders `-` once a sample was taken, or `NA` if the run ended before the first sample. |

Missing values render as `-`; if the run was too short for any sample to
succeed, every resource column is `NA`.

### Per-tick trace (`--trace <PATH>`)

When `--trace` is given, `tricorder` also writes a separate TSV with one row
per sampling tick — useful for "did it spike or stay flat?" plots and for
post-mortem on OOM kills. The aggregate `--out` file is unaffected.

```text
s	rss	vms	uss	pss	io_in	io_out	cpu_time	n_procs	major_page_faults	minor_page_faults	voluntary_ctx_switches	involuntary_ctx_switches	n_threads	swap
0.5012	102.30	2048.00	95.20	96.00	1.25	0.50	0.75	3	0	850	12	1	5	0.00
1.0027	120.45	2048.00	112.10	113.00	2.50	1.00	1.55	3	2	1200	28	3	7	16.50
1.5042	101.50	2048.00	95.20	96.00	2.50	1.00	2.40	2	0	340	15	0	4	8.25
```

| Column | Units | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | seconds (`%.4f`) | Time since `tricorder` started |
| `rss`, `vms`, `uss`, `pss` | MiB (`%.2f`) | **Instantaneous** sum across the live process tree at this tick |
| `io_in`, `io_out` | MiB | **Cumulative** bytes read/written across every PID observed so far (including exited children) |
| `cpu_time` | seconds | Cumulative user + system CPU time across observed PIDs |
| `n_procs` | integer | Number of live processes in this tick |
| `major_page_faults`, `minor_page_faults` | integer | Page faults that occurred *during this tick* (per-tick delta, summed across observed PIDs). Minor is always `-` on macOS. |
| `voluntary_ctx_switches`, `involuntary_ctx_switches` | integer | Context switches that occurred *during this tick* (per-tick delta, summed across observed PIDs). Both are always `-` on macOS. |
| `n_threads` | integer | Live thread count across the tree at this tick (sum across PIDs). Instantaneous, not cumulative. |
| `swap` | MiB | Summed swap usage across the live tree at this tick. Instantaneous, not cumulative. Always `-` on macOS. |

Memory columns are instantaneous, so they can go up *or down* between rows;
I/O, CPU, and the page-fault deltas describe activity within the tick — they
can be zero or non-zero per row but won't drop a previously-counted total.
The trace is `tricord`-native and is **not** affected by `--snakemake`.

### JSON (`--format json`)

Default (full) mode includes `tricord`-added fields:

```json
{"running_time":12.3456,"max_rss":101.5,"max_vms":2048.0,"max_uss":95.2,"max_pss":96.0,"io_in":1.25,"io_out":0.5,"mean_load":175.0,"cpu_time":21.6,"major_page_faults":42,"minor_page_faults":1234,"voluntary_ctx_switches":80,"involuntary_ctx_switches":7,"peak_n_threads":13,"peak_n_procs":4,"loadavg_1m_start":0.50,"loadavg_1m_end":2.25,"max_swap":64.0,"page_cache_start":512.0,"page_cache_end":480.25,"data_collected":true}
```

Under `--snakemake` the `tricord`-added keys are *absent* from the object
(not set to `null`), so downstream parsers that hard-code the Snakemake key
set see exactly what they would have seen from `snakemake.benchmark`:

```json
{"running_time":12.3456,"max_rss":101.5,"max_vms":2048.0,"max_uss":95.2,"max_pss":96.0,"io_in":1.25,"io_out":0.5,"mean_load":175.0,"cpu_time":21.6,"data_collected":true}
```

Raw numeric types, `null` for fields that the platform did not expose.

### Markdown (`--export-markdown <PATH>`)

When `--export-markdown` is given, `tricorder` writes a two-column Markdown
table of the aggregate record to that path, alongside the primary `--out`
file. Designed for pasting into PR descriptions, issue comments, and design
docs — for the per-tick trace, keep using `--trace`.

```markdown
| metric    |   value |
|:----------|--------:|
| s         | 12.3456 |
| h:m:s     | 0:00:12 |
| max_rss   |  101.50 |
| max_vms   | 2048.00 |
| max_uss   |   95.20 |
| max_pss   |   96.00 |
| io_in     |    1.25 |
| io_out    |    0.50 |
| mean_load |  175.00 |
| cpu_time  |   21.60 |
```

Same column order, value formatting, and `-` / `NA` rules as the TSV.

## Platform notes

`tricord` runs on **Linux** and **macOS**. The Linux implementation reads
`/proc/<pid>/{stat,status,smaps_rollup,io}` via the [`procfs`] crate; the
macOS implementation uses [`libproc`]'s `proc_pidinfo` and `proc_pid_rusage`
(`RUSAGE_INFO_V4`).

[`procfs`]: https://crates.io/crates/procfs
[`libproc`]: https://crates.io/crates/libproc

| Metric | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| `max_rss`, `max_vms` | `/proc/<pid>/status` | `proc_taskinfo` |
| `max_uss` | `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` (Private_Clean + Private_Dirty) | `proc_pid_rusage::ri_phys_footprint` |
| `max_pss` | `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` (Pss) | mirrors `max_uss` (kernel does not compute PSS — see below) |
| `io_in`, `io_out` | `/proc/<pid>/io` | `proc_pid_rusage::ri_diskio_*` |
| `cpu_time` | `/proc/<pid>/stat` (utime + stime) | `proc_taskinfo::pti_total_user + pti_total_system` |
| `major_page_faults` | `/proc/<pid>/stat` (majflt) | `proc_pid_rusage::ri_pageins` |
| `minor_page_faults` | `/proc/<pid>/stat` (minflt) | not exposed — column is `-` |
| `voluntary_ctx_switches`, `involuntary_ctx_switches` | `/proc/<pid>/status` (`voluntary_ctxt_switches`, `nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches`) | not split by `proc_pid_rusage` — both columns are `-` |
| `peak_n_threads`, `n_threads` | `/proc/<pid>/status` (`threads`) | `proc_taskinfo::pti_threadnum` |
| `loadavg_1m_start`, `loadavg_1m_end` | `/proc/loadavg` (first field) | `getloadavg(3)` |
| `max_swap`, `swap` | `/proc/<pid>/status` (`VmSwap`) | not exposed — both columns are `-` |
| `page_cache_start`, `page_cache_end` | `/proc/meminfo` (`Cached`) | not exposed — both columns are `-` once a sample was taken, or `NA` if the run ended before the first sample (matching every other resource column). macOS's VM system does not track file-backed page-cache pages as a separate, directly comparable quantity. |

### macOS PSS approximation

The macOS kernel does not compute proportional set size — there is no
equivalent of Linux's `/proc/<pid>/smaps[_rollup]`'s `Pss:` line.
We populate `max_pss` with the same `phys_footprint` value used for
`max_uss`. For benchmarking workloads (a single dominant compute child plus
shared system libraries) the two are typically within a few percent.

If you need real PSS numbers, run on Linux.

## Signals

`tricorder` spawns the child in its own process group and installs handlers
for `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGHUP`. When any of these arrive at `tricorder`,
they are forwarded to the child's process group. `tricorder` then waits for
the child to exit, writes the (partial) output, and returns:

- the child's exit code if it exited normally
- `128 + signum` if the child was killed by a signal

Hitting Ctrl-C during a run thus tears the child down cleanly and still
produces a record you can inspect for "what was happening when I killed it".

## Use as a library

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use tricord::{
    run::{run_command, RunOptions},
    format::OutputFormat,
    SchemaMode,
};

let options = RunOptions {
    interval: Duration::from_millis(500),
    output_path: std::path::Path::new("/tmp/timing.tsv").into(),
    format: OutputFormat::Tsv,
    force_summary: false,
    trace_path: None,
    markdown_path: None,
    schema_mode: SchemaMode::Full,
};
let outcome = run_command("samtools", &["sort".into(), "in.bam".into()], &options).unwrap();
println!("exit={} cpu_time={:.2}s", outcome.exit_code(), outcome.record.cpu_time);
```

## Motivation, and a note on Snakemake

`tricord` started life as a Rust port of an in-house Python helper
(`bench-cmd.py`) that wrapped `snakemake.benchmark.benchmarked()` so we
could time *just* the expensive part of a rule — `benchmark:` measures the
entire `shell:` block, including any prewarming or staging the rule does
before the work you care about.

The default TSV output is therefore bit-format-compatible with
`snakemake.benchmark.write_benchmark_records(extended_fmt=False)`: identical
columns, identical formatting, drop-in replacement for use inside a rule's
`shell:` block. But there's nothing Snakemake-specific about `tricorder`
itself — it's a general-purpose process-tree resource sampler that's just as
happy being invoked by `make`, a CI script, or by hand at a terminal.

A few values are computed slightly more accurately than Snakemake's sampler:

- **`io_in` / `io_out`**: Snakemake reports the latest snapshot's per-process
  values, summed across alive processes. If a child exits between snapshots
  its I/O is dropped. `tricord` keeps the last-observed cumulative value
  per PID and sums those at the end, so an exited child's I/O is still
  counted.
- **`cpu_time`**: same correction — Snakemake takes the latest snapshot's
  alive-process sum; `tricord` accumulates per-PID maxima.
- **`mean_load`**: derived from the corrected `cpu_time`, so it doesn't
  inherit the first-poll-zero quirk from `psutil.cpu_percent()`.

For long, mostly-monolithic runs the differences are well under a percent.
